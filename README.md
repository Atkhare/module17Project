# module17Project

**Overview** 
In this practical application, the goal is to compare the performance of the classifiers, namely K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. The data was collect by Portuguese bank that used its own contact-center to do directed marketing campaigns. The telephone, with a human agent as the interlocutor, was the dominant marketing channel, although sometimes with an auxiliary use of the Internet online banking channel (e.g. by showing information to specific targeted client).

**Business Understanding**
The business goal is to find a model that can explain success of a contact with client, i.e. if the client subscribes the term deposit. The classification model can increase campaign efficiency by identifying the main characteristics that affect success, helping in a better management of the available resources (e.g. human effort, phone calls, time) and selection of a high quality and affordable set of potential buying customers. 

**Data Source** 
The dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing).  The data is from a Portugese banking institution and is a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns. The article accompanying the dataset [here](CRISP-DM-BANK.pdf) is being referred for more information on the data and its features.
